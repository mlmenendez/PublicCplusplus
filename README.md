C++ Examples  
This repo contains various examples of C++ code.
The code came from assignments, both school related and personal design.
The point of this repo is demonstrate understanding of typical data structures and algorithms
that would be used in a junior level development position.
  Each project is split into different branches off of the master for organizational purposes (also I didn't want to make a repo for each project)
